Deep Learning Based Product Reordering Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a user will reorder a product based on their past purchase behavior using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset, the model helps businesses optimize personalized product recommendations, improve inventory management, boost customer retention, and enhance marketing strategies by accurately forecasting reorder patterns.

The core of the project involves extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to build a comprehensive user-product interaction dataset. Features include user behavior metrics (such as average days between orders), product reorder statistics, and user-product interaction histories. These features are carefully preprocessed — handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data — to serve as inputs to a deep neural network classifier.

The deep learning model is trained and validated using binary classification techniques, with a focus on preventing overfitting through regularization and early stopping. The project evaluates model performance using classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix analysis, aiming for a robust and deployment-ready predictive solution.

This project emphasizes clean code practices, modular design, and reproducibility, ensuring it can be easily extended or integrated into real-world e-commerce or retail analytics pipelines.
